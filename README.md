# Online-Quiz-Maker

Covid-19 is transforming our education system from its traditional methods to the online form. Educators are using many online forums to make the classes more interactive and to test their students. Some of the famous forums would be Kahoot, Google forms, etc. With all these forums, educators have to spend so much time on adding questions one by one. This makes it hard for educators to make multiple quizzes on the same day. The project is for making classes more interactive and to help educators in understanding their learner's pace.
